# Supervised Machine Learning

## Overview of the Project
Train and evaluate machine learning models to predict risky loans given data with unbalanced classes. The following resampling methods were employed:
1. Oversample data using RandomOverSampler
2. Oversample data using SMOTE
3. Undersample data using ClusterCentroids
4. Use a combination method using SMOTEENN

## Resources
- Data Source: LoanStats_2019Q1.csv
- Software: Python 3.7.1, Jupyter Notebook, Scikit-learn and Imbalanced-learn libraries

## Extension
Train, evaluate and compare two different ensemble classifiers listed below to predict loan risk.
1. Balanced Random Forest Classifier
2. Easy Ensemble AdaBoost Classifier

## Summary
The full analysis of the models is provided at the bottom of each ipynb file.
